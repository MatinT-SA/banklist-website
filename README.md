# branches
In this project we made use of several branches to learn how to handle multiple branches and merging them wit each other such as:
- main (default branch)
- customization
- responsiveness
- tab
- slider
- scroll
# Pull Requests
Also in this project I learned how to handle Pull Requests through GitHub CLI. Although, the only contributor to this project was me but I tried to challenge myself in this case.

# banklist-web-app
You can get connected to my previous repo I was working on which was my banklist-web-app throught signing up section. You don't have to fill up the form but you can simply go through
the next step to visit banklist web application as well. These two projects were only concerned with the front-end and that's why making an account doesn't make sense.
